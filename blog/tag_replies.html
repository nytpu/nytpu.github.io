<p><a href="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/~swiftmandolin/gemlog/01-9-20-swiftmandolin.gmi">a reply to swiftmandolin&rsquo;s post</a></p>

<h2>random before-post missives</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying out replying like you would reply on gopher (<a href="gemini://carcosa.net:1965/journal/20200529-some-replies.gmi">although I&rsquo;m not sure
this is the best way to do it</a>) so we&rsquo;ll see how this goes. Also, I think
I&rsquo;m going to abandon hosting my blog anywhere else and just focus on a gemlog,
because while markdown works on everything it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work <em>well</em> for
anything. Once I roll my own blog utility for just gemini then maybe I&rsquo;ll even
try to get it on spacewalk considering that I&rsquo;m posting here way more than I
originally thought I would. As a final aside, I switched my style of writing.
I&rsquo;m gonna stick with this because having longer passages of text be all
lowercase just gets hard to read sometimes, but my mastodon posts and shorter
stuff like that will still be all lowercase because I like the look better for
short stuff.</p>

<h2>creating a pseudonym (aka don&rsquo;t make the same mistakes i made)</h2>

<blockquote><p>…finding unique usernames on the internet is getting increasingly difficult…</p></blockquote>

<p>— someone, somewhere</p>

<p>I originally derived &ldquo;nytpu&rdquo; from my name via a <strong>super-secret method</strong> because
I wanted something that was short and relatively memorable while being random
enough to be available on most platforms. It seems I was successful at this,
although it wasn&rsquo;t available on twitter for some miraculous reason, not that I
really use twitter regularly anyways. The point I&rsquo;m trying to make here is that
nytpu wasn&rsquo;t originally meant to be a pseudonym that I actively try to keep
separate from my real identity, and that means I&rsquo;m left with some lingering
connections to my identity that I have to work around, whereas a pseudonym like
swiftmandolin&rsquo;s was created with the explicit purpose of being pseudonymous,
and allows more freedoms because of that.</p>

<h2>becoming private</h2>

<h3>the tug-of-war of privacy</h3>

<blockquote><p>Keeping your privacy isn&rsquo;t an absolute, all-or-nothing, venture.</p></blockquote>

<p>— r/privacy FAQ</p>

<p>The biggest thing about being private is you have to decide the level of
privacy you want, and how far you&rsquo;re willing to go to reach that level of
privacy. If you want to maximise your privacy you should just lock yourself in
a Kaczynski cabin in northern Canada and never touch a computer or interact
with anyone else. At the opposite end is having wifi-connected cameras and
amazon echos and/or google homes in every room of your home. If you want to be
maximally private but still use the internet you <a href="https://github.com/maqp/tfc">can get pretty extreme</a>,
but the problem is even if you use that no one else except people currently
being targeted by nation-states use that, so you are left with a near-perfectly
secure and private communications network with no one to use it with. With a
more commonplace but anecdotal experience, I have the option of either: 1)
dropping out of school, or 2) using zoom, so I use zoom and make sure to use
good SELinux policies and I only use zoom for what I&rsquo;m required for. Another
example is discord, I would not have any contact with my friends if I didn&rsquo;t
use it, so I use it just for that, and don&rsquo;t connect it to my identity,
although if you were really looking then you could probably tell just via who I
chat with.</p>

<p>These tradeoffs are why imperfect, but still secure services like signal are so
popular, because they have better privacy, but you don&rsquo;t have to deal with as
many of these usability tradeoffs so you can get your less tech-literate
family and friends to use it, <em>and</em> it works with existing networks like SMS so
you can still contact people you were contacting before. To concisely sum up
these examples, with privacy you should aim for &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo;</p>

<h3>my personal privacy</h3>

<blockquote><p>In my opinion, we should begin in total privacy and choose to open what we
want instead of having to &ldquo;reclaim&rdquo; our privacy. But, c'est la vie.</p></blockquote>

<p>— swiftmandolin</p>

<p>Instead of writing a long paragraph I&rsquo;m just going to enumerate things I do for
privacy, and there&rsquo;s some security thrown in too because the two sort-of go
hand-in-hand:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Linux instead of Windows or MacOS <del>X</del> (I&rsquo;d do this anyway even
if it didn&rsquo;t have a privacy benefit)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use centralized social media… ok I do still use reddit but I don&rsquo;t use
facebook and only use twitter to follow 2 people</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use google except where I have to for school, and then I use it
sandboxed in a different browser</li>
<li>Using a VPN</li>
<li>Sign emails with PGP, although I can&rsquo;t use encryption because I don&rsquo;t know a
<em>single</em> other person with pgp that I could encrypt with.</li>
<li>Using Signal and convincing family to use it</li>
<li>Using a Pi Hole + local Privoxy + strong adblocker</li>
<li>Using a degoogled &amp; rooted phone (this gives more user freedom too!)</li>
<li>Good email hosting that lets you use a custom domain</li>
<li>Try to secure browser</li>
</ol>


<p>Stuff that I know I should fix but don&rsquo;t:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using discord — I basically have to if I want to contact most of my irl
friends</li>
<li>Using a chromium-based browser (qutebrowser) — I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to
change it, I love qutebrowser so much</li>
<li>Logging most of the movies I watch on letterboxd — I don&rsquo;t really know why I
do this, but I&rsquo;m just obsessed with having a log of all the movies I watch.
If anyone knows a local program or something self-hosted that does this,
please email me at alex@nytpu.com!</li>
<li>Using DuckDuckGo — It isn&rsquo;t perfect for privacy, but no other search
engine gives me useful results for all the weird and obscure stuff I look
up. Even DDG doesn&rsquo;t give good results for stuff sometimes and I have to
pull up google through tor.</li>
<li>Not using my VPN enough — sometimes I turn it off just because I need the
fastest download speeds I can get when downloading stuff.</li>
<li>Tying my name to nytpu — I accidentally did this early on so now I just said
screw it, it&rsquo;s not even my real name anyways even though people use it irl</li>
<li>Tying my location to nytpu — I managed to reveal it slowly where I revealed
bits and pieces until I just said I don&rsquo;t care anymore (just look at my
photography page on gemini: Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Great Sand Dunes? It&rsquo;s
not hard to figure out). There are presumably quite a few Alexs who live in
Colorado, so I&rsquo;m not particularly worried about this either.</li>
</ol>


<h2>concluding things</h2>

<blockquote><p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of a good quote about conclusions so now I&rsquo;m quoting myself</p></blockquote>

<p>— nytpu</p>

<p>In the end, I believe that privacy is a human right, and the fact that you have
to do this kind of shit to get even a façade of privacy is literally
disgusting. I&rsquo;m gonna cut myself off here, but somehow have even more to say
about this, and even just this post got really out of hand, I originally
intended it to be a quick reply. I&rsquo;ve never really written anything about
privacy before despite me being so privacy oriented, so I just had a lot that I
wanted to get out. I didn&rsquo;t even get into free speech stuff yet! Maybe in a
future post…</p>
