oh yeah, tilde.team!

I recently got on [tilde.team][1], a wonderful shared Linux system that has an
amazing community and awesome services. I'm currently writing this blog post
with their [bashblog][2] program. I've just gotten signed up, so I'm still
poking around with the various services and it seems interesting.

I just wanted to create an initial post here, I'll update later when I have a
more complete impression or something new to write about.
