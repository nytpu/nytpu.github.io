i got a real server finally!

i finally got a real vps and migrated my website off of the amalgamation of
random [ass-services][1] (i'm not implying they were bad services) and
centralize them here. i had my main site (nytpu.com, excluding the blog) on
github pages (bleugh), my blog on tilde.team, and a bunch of random services
like nextcloud on my home "server" (totally not a desktop that doesn't have a
monitor) that has the worst uptime and reliability ever. i decided on
[prgmr][2] for hosting, for no particular reason. i also took the time to
migrate over to nginx because i got tired of apache (not that i ever hit a
point where i noticed the performance losses of apache but i just don't really
like it) but never got around to switching over, but now since i basically got
everything set up from scratch i figured i might as well. i *might* still run
nextcloud on my home server because i've got 18tib of storage on there in a zfs
array and making use of it via a cloud would be nice
