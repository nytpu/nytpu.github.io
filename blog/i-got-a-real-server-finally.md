i got a real server finally!

i finally got a real vps and migrated my website off of the amalgamation of
random-ass services (i'm not implying they were bad services) and centralize
them here. i had my main site (nytpu.com, excluding the blog) on github
(bleugh) pages, my blog on tilde.team, and a bunch of random services like
nextcloud on my home "server" (totally not a desktop that doesn't have a
monitor) that has the worst uptime and reliability ever. i decided on
[prgmr][1] for hosting, for no particular reason other than i'd heard of them
before and they were affordable. i also took the time to migrate over to nginx
because i got tired of apache (not that i ever hit a point where i noticed the
performance losses of apache but i just don't really like it) but never got
around to switching over in the past, but now since i basically got everything
set up from scratch i figured i might as well. i *might* still run nextcloud on
my home server because i've got 18tib of storage on there in a zfs array and
making use of it via a cloud would be nice
