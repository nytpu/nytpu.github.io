<p>I don't pretend to be a film critic or anything, although I do have a taste for
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/341687-waves-98">obscure</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/8327-the-holy-mountain">avant</a>-<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/4960-synecdoche-new-york">garde</a> films as long as I can get meaning out of
it.  To get to the point, I just watched <em>The Wicker Man</em>, which a very
peculiar film because it <em>feels</em> like it should have some deeper meanings and
themes, like <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/361292-suspiria"><em>Suspira</em> (2018)</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/503919-the-lighthouse"><em>The Lighthouse</em></a>, and yet I can't
manage to pull anything out of it. It has Christian and Celtic <del>pagan</del>
heathen symbols, but I can't manage to figure out what they represent, unlike
in many other films where those have a deeper meaning connected with the rest
of the themes and plot. I was hoping to have more to say, but this post is
obviously going to be short because the whole point of it is that I can't
really say anything else about it other than: 1) it's really frustrating that I
can't pull any deeper meaning or themes from it even though it feels like I
should be able to; and 2) this actually is a really good horror film, and I
still wholeheartedly recommend it. It feels like <em>The Exorcist</em>, kind of, maybe
it's that they were both made in 1973 and they are both religious themed.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I plan on writing an analysis of <em>The Lighthouse</em>
sometime, because it's an excellent, excellent film, I just have to watch it
again first.</p>
