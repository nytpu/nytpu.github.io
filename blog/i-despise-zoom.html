<blockquote><p>Zoom hasn&rsquo;t killed keybase as far as I know</p></blockquote>

<p>â€” some asshole on github</p>

<p><a href="/img/blog/f64c39e2-376f-4de1-a101-5b88593eafe9.png">fuck you.</a> the server still isn&rsquo;t open sourced and at this rate it never
will be, so it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>

<p>the <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom">keybase aquisition</a> fiasco is what really started me on this train of
thought because i&rsquo;d never really used zoom before that anyways. now i have to
use it for virtual classes and i realize how much i hate it, and not just from
an ideological perspective.</p>

<p>the app (on linux at least, but i assume for every platform) is so buggy,
resource heavy (what &ldquo;professional&rdquo; app isn&rsquo;t these days though (and it&rsquo;s not
just because of all the video, it&rsquo;s just poorly optimized (i really use a lot
of parentheses don&rsquo;t i :)))), and does seemingly everything just wrong. the
first thing i noticed was that instead of having audio output use the user&rsquo;s
volume, they force the system volume to 100% then make you use the volume
controls built-into the app, which is really great when you want to listen to
something else simultaneously, or when you forget after a call and put on music
and have your eardrums blown out. it makes it impossible to do anything else on
my computer when i&rsquo;m on a call, but i think that&rsquo;s probably more my computer
struggling to handle video than zoom itself. the only good thing i have to say
about the app is that it&rsquo;s nice that it doesn&rsquo;t still do video in the
background when you have the app minimized to the little mini
picture-in-picture thing, which helps when i&rsquo;m trying to actually do something
else on my computer too.</p>

<p>the privacy implications of even having it installed is worrying too, and with
them not just routing through china, but actually <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/03/zooms-encryption-is-not-suited-for-secrets-and-has-surprising-links-to-china-researchers-discover/">generating encryption keys
in china</a> doesn&rsquo;t make me feel confident in the &ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;"encryption&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo; that they use, even if they have the keybase people
slaving away over it.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t really have anything else original to say, but i felt the need to rant
briefly about zoom, primarily because they are slowly killing keybase which was
one my my favorite things.</p>
