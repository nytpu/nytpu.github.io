the wicker man analysis(?)

I don't pretend to be a film critic or anything, although I do have a taste for
[obscure][1] or [avant][2]-[garde][3] films as long as I can get meaning out of
it.  To get to the point, I just watched *The Wicker Man*, which a very
peculiar film because it *feels* like it should have some deeper meanings and
themes, like [*Suspira* (2018)][4] or [*The Lighthouse*][5], and yet I can't
manage to pull anything out of it. It has Christian and Celtic <del>pagan</del>
heathen symbols, but I can't manage to figure out what they represent, unlike
in many other films where those have a deeper meaning connected with the rest
of the themes and plot. I was hoping to have more to say, but this post is
obviously going to be short because the whole point of it is that I can't
really say anything else about it other than: 1) it's really frustrating that I
can't pull any deeper meaning or themes from it even though it feels like I
should be able to; and 2) this actually is a really good horror film, and I
still wholeheartedly recommend it. It feels like *The Exorcist*, kind of, maybe
it's that they were both made in 1973 and they are both religious themed.

On an unrelated note, I plan on writing an analysis of *The Lighthouse*
sometime, because it's an excellent, excellent film, I just have to watch it
again first.
