<p>some may say that the math problems featured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_Around_You">look around you</a> are
impossible, but i am here to attempt to calculate them using the power of
maths.</p>

<h3>problem one</h3>

<p><strong>question:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>jean is shorter than brutus, but taller than imhotep. imhotep is taller than
  jean but shorter than lord scotland. lord scotland is twice the height of
  jean and brutus combined, but only a tenth of the height of millsy. millsy is
  at a constant height of x-y. if jean stands exactly 1 nautical mile away from
  lord scotland, how tall is imhotep?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>official answer:</strong> imhotep is invisible.</p>

<p>the joke for this problem is that it&rsquo;s obviously contradictory and impossible,
however, the problem never specifies that there can&rsquo;t be two people with the
same name.</p>

<p>imhotep &lt; jean 1 &lt; brutus<br/>
jean 2 &lt; imhotep &lt; lord scotland<br/>
lord scotland = (jean 1 + brutus) * 2<br/>
millsy = lord scotland / 10<br/>
millsy = x-y<br/>
jean 2 one nautical mile away from lord scotland<br/>
imhotep = ?</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know where to go from here</p>

<h3>problem two</h3>

<p><strong>question:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>eight ladies go into eight shops at eight o'clock in the morning. each lady
  wants to buy eight spiders. for each spider, eight spider shoes must be
  bought.  but, they only have eight pounds between them. with each spider
  costing eightpence, and each spider shoe costing an eighthpence each, will
  the ladies have enough change for the bus home, a journey costing eightpence
  per stop and made up of eight stops.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>official answer:</strong> the ladies were eightpence short.</p>

<p>this one is fairly simple, it&rsquo;s just a matter of multiplication.</p>

<p>8 ladies * (8 spiders * 0.08 pounds + 8 spider shoes * 0.008 pounds + 8 stops * .08 pounds) =<br/>
<strong>10.752 pounds</strong></p>

<p>the ladies were 2.76 pounds short.</p>

<h3>problem three</h3>

<p><strong>question:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>it&rsquo;s the future, and queen elizabeth iii and queen elizabeth iv are
  going to party held by queen elizabeth v, and are keen to make the right
  impression, so it&rsquo;s important that they choose their outfits carefully. queen
  elizabeth iii has forty dresses to choose from, whereas queen elizabeth iv
  has four thousand. queen elizabeth v has just one dress, but it has the
  ability to transform itself into the shape of any dress. the night before the
  party, queen elizabeth iv&rsquo;s handmaiden steals the patterns to queen elizabeth
  iii&rsquo;s dresses, and working through till dawn, makes forty exact replicas. can
  you calculate the probability that all three queens will be wearing the same
  dress at the party, and how many times can queen elizabeth v&rsquo;s dress change
  before it overheats?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>official answer:</strong> the party was cancelled</p>

<p>assuming that every dress in elizabeth iii&rsquo;s and elizabeth iv&rsquo;s wardrobes are
equally likely to be chosen, then each dress in elizabeth iii&rsquo;s collection has
a 1/40 chance of being warn, while elizabeth iv&rsquo;s dresses have a 1/4040 chance
after the duplicates are made. however, since queen elizabeth v dress can
change into <em>any</em> dress, the probably of her wearing any specific dress
approaches zero. therefore, it can be assumed that the probability of all three
wearing the same dress is zero. to answer the second part, the video shows that
elizabeth the v&rsquo;s dress can change fourteen times before overheating.</p>

<p>i finally got a real vps and migrated my website off of the amalgamation of
random-ass services (i&rsquo;m not implying they were bad services) and centralize
them here. i had my main site (nytpu.com, excluding the blog) on github
(bleugh) pages, my blog on tilde.team, and a bunch of random services like
nextcloud on my home &ldquo;server&rdquo; (totally not a desktop that doesn&rsquo;t have a
monitor) that has the worst uptime and reliability ever. i decided on
<a href="https://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> for hosting, for no particular reason other than i&rsquo;d heard of them
before and they were affordable. i also took the time to migrate over to nginx
because i got tired of apache (not that i ever hit a point where i noticed the
performance losses of apache but i just don&rsquo;t really like it) but never got
around to switching over in the past, but now since i basically got everything
set up from scratch i figured i might as well. i <em>might</em> still run nextcloud on
my home server because i&rsquo;ve got 18tib of storage on there in a zfs array and
making use of it via a cloud would be nice</p>

<p>i've been enamoured with the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini protocol</a> ever since i've heard of it,
and am proud to be hosting this blog on gemini and gopher as well as on the web
(i'm actually the one who <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog/pulls/2">added gemini support</a> to the bashblog program
that i use to write this blog). i got that set up a few months ago (as of
writing this) but haven't really worked much with it other than that. well now,
i have plenty of time and due to a lack of other projects to be working on i'm
starting to experiment with gemini a little more.</p>

<p>i found this <a href="gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/">astrobotany</a> game (which is a port of the botany game i played
on ~team) and it gave me an idea that i'm <del>going to start</del> working on.
it's an interactive cgi (in the dynamic page generation sense not the movie
special effects sense) game thing, and i hope to push the limits of what the
gemini protocol can do, considering that you can't dynamically update a page
(which is an <em>objective</em> benefit for everything excluding games). i was
thinking old school text adventure, that probably wouldn't even be at a <em>Zork</em>
or <em>Dunnet</em> level but more <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>. since the issue isn't the
back end i was thinking running <a href="https://davidgriffith.gitlab.io/frotz/">frotz</a> (a z-machine interpreter) and
somehow wrapping gemini around the output, but we'll have to see how that goes
once i start getting server software up and running.</p>

<p>this whole post was originally meant just to plug gemini some more—because it's
amazing—but i ended up having some cool ideas that the gemini protocol (might)
be able to allow that gopher doesn't easily support, and the web is just too
bloated and it feels too much like actual work instead of a fun projects to get
anything up and running on there. i hope something of interest comes to
fruition because not much else has these past few months and i want more to
write about!</p>

<p>I don't pretend to be a film critic or anything, although I do have a taste for
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/341687-waves-98">obscure</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/8327-the-holy-mountain">avant</a>-<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/4960-synecdoche-new-york">garde</a> films as long as I can get meaning out of
it.  To get to the point, I just watched <em>The Wicker Man</em>, which a very
peculiar film because it <em>feels</em> like it should have some deeper meanings and
themes, like <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/361292-suspiria"><em>Suspira</em> (2018)</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/503919-the-lighthouse"><em>The Lighthouse</em></a>, and yet I can't
manage to pull anything out of it. It has Christian and Celtic <del>pagan</del>
heathen symbols, but I can't manage to figure out what they represent, unlike
in many other films where those have a deeper meaning connected with the rest
of the themes and plot. I was hoping to have more to say, but this post is
obviously going to be short because the whole point of it is that I can't
really say anything else about it other than: 1) it's really frustrating that I
can't pull any deeper meaning or themes from it even though it feels like I
should be able to; and 2) this actually is a really good horror film, and I
still wholeheartedly recommend it. It feels like <em>The Exorcist</em>, kind of, maybe
it's that they were both made in 1973 and they are both religious themed.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I plan on writing an analysis of <em>The Lighthouse</em>
sometime, because it's an excellent, excellent film, I just have to watch it
again first.</p>

<h2>finishing up first-stage character design</h2>

<p>I left off my last post with unfinished sprites and tilemaps. They're still
unfinished now, but I still needed to finish up the basics and get the player
character sprite designed before I could continue work on other aspects. I got
the basic ground and one obstacle for the hub designed, and all I needed was
the player character before I could get started coding. The problem is, I had
plenty of ideas for other NPCs in the game, but literally no idea what the
player character should look like. However, through sheer luck, I was randomly
doodling in <a href="https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite">Aseprite</a> (my preferred sprite editor, although there's <a href="https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues/977">no
tilemap editor yet</a>) and drew a strange little outline, and it looked pretty
good. "Maybe this will be another NPC" I thought. But, after cleaning it up and
turning the random colors I picked into a palette, it looked really good (at
least to other pixel art things I've done before). I christened him Schnoz for
his huge schnoz, and decided that since it's the only character I've actually
designed so far, that he was going to be the main character. Adding a second
frame for a simple animation (see! I'm not so inexperienced that I don't know
about the wonders of XOR for animations). I decided that he looked like a
dolphin and added a blowhole and changed his colors to be more blue-grey to
match a dolphin's. I tried to add a tail, but I just couldn't get it to look
good, and it looks good enough without it anyway. Just ignore the fact that
since he's a dolphin his schnoz isn't actually a nose at all. </p>

<h2>getting it to something the gba understands</h2>

<p>This section title may be a little on the nose, but it's exactly what I needed
to do next. I have all these <strike>beautiful</strike> okay sprites and
tilemaps, but how do I get a modern image format into the GBA? Well, there's a
tool called <a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#grit">grit</a>—written by cearn, who also wrote <a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/tonc/">tonclib</a>—that
converts images to either <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files or into another of a range of
binary formats depending on how you want to work with the data in the GBA. I
already knew that I wanted to use the <a href="https://pineight.com/gba/#gbfs">Game Boy File System</a> because working
with a bunch of <code>.c</code> files that contain your data is a pain especially if the
data is compressed and you have to use the GBA BIOS to decompress it, so I
simply fired up grit and had it convert the images into plain LZ77-compressed
binary files that I then shoved into a GBFS tarball and added it to the ROM.
With that good, I managed to get it to read and decompress the files from GBFS
with relative ease, and now I was finally able to pull out my tonc knowledge
that I spent all that time learning last blog post. Loading the tilemap data,
tile data, and character tiles into the right spots, then flipping the right
switches, and adding basic input methods to scroll the background, and voilà,
things were displayed and I could look around the map by moving the screen, and
the first actual version, <a href="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/src/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0</a>, was released.</p>

<h2>creating some semblance of an actual game</h2>

<p>With stuff actually working, I hurriedly got Schnoz displayed and moving around
with the arrow keys. However, then came a part which was more difficult than I
thought. I wanted the background to scroll when Schnoz reached the outer ¼ of
the screen, but for the background to stop scrolling when it reached the edges
of the map. I still haven't figured out how to do it without using <a href="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/src/tag/v0.2.0/src/main.c#L68-L82">these <code>if</code>
statements</a>. I still think that I might wrap it in it's own function
somehow, but I deliberately didn't break out anything yet. However, with Schnoz
now being able to levitate around the screen and ghost through objects,
<a href="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/src/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was completed. The next order of business is to add gravity (easy)
then add collisions with the terrain (difficult), so we'll see how that goes.</p>

<h2>introduction and choosing a console</h2>

<p>Around November 2019, I decided that I wanted to make a game on a retro
console! Something that I've wanted to do for a while, but have never actually
done. I have experience programming older systems, and my first instinct was to
write it in TMS9900 Assembly on my TI-99/4A, and I've written basic to
moderately advanced <em>programs</em> on it, but <a href="http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/hardware/chips/tms9918a.html">looking at the palette</a>, limited
number of sprites—16 TOTAL, not just on one scanline!—and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/tibook_fundamentals-of-ti994a-assembly-language/page/n63/mode/2up">annoying 256
bytes of directly addressable ram</a> while <a href="https://archive.org/details/tibook_fundamentals-of-ti994a-assembly-language/page/n65/mode/2up">hiding 16KiB of memory behind the
VDP</a> makes it <em>really</em> bad for games <a href="https://www.harmlesslion.com/text/Dragons%20Lair%20on%20the%20TI-99_4A.pdf">unless you're a genius programmer and
hardware hacker with lots of time.</a></p>

<p>With the TI-99/4A out, the <em>obvious</em> next logical system to choose is the Game
Boy (I only chose it because it was the only other retro system with a flash
cart I had lying around other than a TI CC-40, which, while being a very
interesting system, and shows TI's transition from home computing to
calculators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_Compact_Computer_40">is not good for games</a>). However, I didn't know a lick of Game
Boy assembly, and, upon researching, there seems to be no accurate reference
other than the <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/">GB Pan Docs</a> and not one accurate finished tutorial, nor any
books other than Nintendo's development manual. I realized that trying to learn
GB assembly using pure reference manuals while jumping right into making an
ambitious game, while doable, was probably not a good idea.</p>

<p>I really wanted to write it in assembly, because I'm a crazy person, but the
only other system I had lying around was a GBA, but I didn't have a flash cart
for it. I picked up a relatively cheap <a href="https://www.ezflashomega.com/products/EZ-Flash-Omega.html">EZ Flash Omega</a> and I was good on
that front. Now, armed with a flash cart, I decided that I would lose my dream
of writing a game in assembly and would just write in C for the GBA, because,
while I didn't know GBA programming, I know embedded programming and C, so it
wouldn't take much to learn about the GBA, plus there's an <a href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">excellent
tutorial</a> that I could run through before actually getting started on the
game. And, I could always write the functions that needed to be optimized the
most in assembly still anyway.</p>

<h2>planning and learning about the gba</h2>

<p>With my console picked out, it was now time to formalize my ideas and plans for
my game (still untitled because I'm bad at that), but first, I needed to learn
about the GBA, it's capabilities, and what I would be likely able to program on
it with my ability. Preferably have some practice writing stuff for it too, so
I could jump right into making it after planning it out.</p>

<p>So, I started reading through the <a href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">tonc tutorial</a>, and ran through each
section, and tried to make a demo utilizing everything I learned at the end of
each section ("Basics", "Extended", etc.).</p>

<p>However, I decided to take a little break after "Extended" and get a head start
on planning, and start working on the graphics for the game. I had tons of
ideas bouncing around my head and I wanted to write them down, organize them,
and formalize them before I forgot anything.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://tilde.team/~nytpu/blog/playing-with-the-steam-controller.html">just replayed Squirm</a>, so a lot of the ideas I have (primarily the color
palettes) are inspired by it. My main first ideas were to have a series of
zones ("worlds"), that are connected together à la Metroid. The main world is
to be a hub, that is designed with a primarily greyscale, dark color scheme. It
is primarily rock themed, and will try to capture a cave-like feel. The primary
obstacles will be platforming sections around spikes and other physical
obstacles. All of the other worlds aren't going to connect to each other, and
will only be connected to the hub, for simplicity of programming, and for
enforcing some form of linearity.</p>

<p>The next world (although I may rearrange them later) is a "fire" or "lava"
world (I call it fire), that is obviously orange-red themed. The main surface
will be sort-of brick themed, but more flat, more akin to lightly textured
stone. The main obstacle will be lava, possibly flowing or mobile, and will
have unkillable fireball "enemies" also.</p>

<p>The next world may be a water world, but I may change it to a castle or similar
themed world. However, the main world that I'm excited for will be the final or
second-to-final world, and will initially be cheerful and brightly themed, and
be meadow-like. However, after a short distance, it will slowly transition to a
brown, dead, corrupted color palette, and will become cavernous, with difficult
enemies and obstacles.</p>

<p>The rest of the game is yet to be determined, but, as each world will be fairly
long, and I don't necessarily want the game itself to be very long, these
worlds may very well be sufficient.</p>

<h2>spriting</h2>

<p>The most current artwork is available on the art branch: <a href="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/src/branch/art/art">https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/src/branch/art/art</a></p>

<p>Now we get to where I am now, where I'm designing the sprites for each world. I
started out by pulling up <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors</a> and using the palette generator to find
a background and foreground color that I liked for the world I'm designing.
After finding those, I copied the hex codes into the gradient palette generator
to get a gradient of 6 colors that I then imported back into the normal palette
generator to touch up. While on the GBA I can have 16 colors per palette, I
prefer to use fewer colors because I'm not very good at pixel art, and using
fewer colors makes it easier and helps enforce a style. For the overworld
palette, I started out generating a nice green palette in the same way I did
previously, but added a sky-blue background on top of the 6 green colors, and
added 3 additional "accent" colors, that I'll use for flowers and things. Then
I duplicated the green palette and messed with the saturation and brightness
until I got the brown colors I wanted. I then manually changed shades for each
color, touching them up until it was how I wanted. The only thing is I'm going
to have to clamp the colors into the GBA's colorspace, so we'll see how that
goes.</p>

<p><img src="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/raw/branch/art/art/overworld/overworld_good_palette.png" alt="Overworld 'Good' Palette" title="can't you just read the title underneath the palette? it says 'overworld good palette'" />
<img src="https://tildegit.org/nytpu/game/raw/branch/art/art/overworld/overworld_decaying_palette.png" alt="Overworld 'Corrputed' Palette" title="i just went over this last title text, just read under the image or the alt text, you don't need to be here." /></p>

<p>Once I got the palette all generated for the world I was looking on, I then
started working on the base ground tile (<code>&lt;world&gt;_ground</code> in the repo). I
decided on using 16x16px tiles because 8x8px was way too constricting. Once I
got that how I wanted, I copied it into the tilemap 9 times into a square, and
3 more times into a line. I then added borders how I wanted. For the overworld,
I don't have to make different tiles for the "good" and "corrupted" variations,
because I can just toggle the palette in software and it will automatically
change the colors. However, I will still export the image in both palettes to
ensure that it is viewable in both variants. I continued working on the other
tiles in much the same way, and am still working on this process for all of the
worlds.</p>

work-in-progress tilemap for the hub
</p>

<h2>the future</h2>

<p>I still have to finish up tiles, and then work on sprites, but I also should
work on sound and music too. However, the only experience I have with sound is
with LSDj on the Game Boy, and even then I barely understand GB audio. I get
the feeling I may be relegated to the digital audio channels for the GBA, but
even then I probably will work on sound dead last, the most I may do is write
in dummy functions for actions so sound could be called later. I'm probably
going to finish up the hub sprites then start coding in core game logic and the
game loop.</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully my next post will be significantly shorter, but I had a lot of
introduction to get through, and a lot to write about because I only decided to
write a chronological dev log now, when I was previously planning on writing
one complete overview when I was completely done (although I still plan on
doing that). Check out the repo linked at the beginning of this post to see my
current progress, although I don't push until I make a major commit.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This post is written in my long, rambling epistolary style because
I haven't really planned out what I wanted to say before writing it, so be
prepared.</p>

<p>I recently, out of boredom, dug out my steam controller that I've had lying
around since it launched (2015?). I remembered that it was pretty horrible to
use, but I don't have any other controllers that have a joystick. In fact, the
only other controller I have that works with modern computers is a <a href="https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-usb-controller">clone SNES
controller</a> (it wasn't that expensive when I got it) from the now-defunct
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP_(computer)">NextThingCo.</a> (I plan on writing about the PocketCHIP someday, because it's
amazing). However, once you get used to it, I've found that, excluding a few
exceptions, that the Steam Controller is equal to, or better than a controller
for many games, although I still prefer playing with a mouse or keyboard when
possible.  My current use case is playing on my couch using my "server" that's
plugged into my T.V., and the steam controller was specifically designed for
that purpose, so my use case is normal. </p>

<h2>using the controller</h2>

<p>After pulling the controller out and dusting it off, with some help from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamController/">the
SteamController subreddit</a> I pulled up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/778330/Squirm/">Squirm</a>, a wonderful platforming
game that I'd been meaning to replay anyways. After lots of fiddling with the
config, I finally got to a point where I could play through the early sections
semi-reliably. I was thinking "oh, it's okay" pretty much the whole time. After
I got to the spookelium boss, I then decided to mess with the config more and,
after 30 minutes of fiddling, got to a configuration where I felt much better
and more precise with my movements, as well as some QoL things like autofire.
"That was pretty neat" I thought, and proceeded to continue playing through the
game, all the way to the end, where the levels get punishingly difficult, and
that was where I really started getting to a point where I thought the
controller might be more useful than just a novelty.</p>

<p>Finishing Squirm, I played through an old favorite, Portal, and after some
rebinding and mouse sensitivity changes, I again got to a very usable,
enjoyable point. Making extensive use of the gyro for more precise aiming makes
for almost as quick and precise of an experience as using a mouse, which was
really unexpected. Playing Portal 2 with a similar profile had a similar
experience, leaving me very happy with a very strange controller I previously
thought was fairly useless.</p>

<h2>interesting features</h2>

<p>And now we get to where where I want to talk about the controller itself. My
favorite aspect of it is the gyro, which is nonexistent or completely unused in
any other controller. The only common controller that has a gyro that I know of
is the DualShock 4, but it goes mostly unused other than gimmicky things like
"shake the flashlight." Actually using the gyro though, gives you nearly the
speed and accuracy of an actual mouse, which is really amazing for a
controller.</p>

<p>The next thing about it, which is the first thing anyone notices about it, is
the two touchpads. I still think I prefer a joystick for movement, because it's
easier to use a joystick and tell where your finger is on it, and it has a
better tactile feel. I also think I still prefer actual buttons instead of
using the trackpad for buttons, because it's easier to rapid-fire press
buttons, or keep your finger on them instead of having to hover over the
trackpad. However, using the trackpad for either mouse movement or to emulate a
right-stick on a regular controller is where it really shines, as it is more
precise, easier to use, and just wonderful all around, especially when combined
with the gyro for super-precise aiming, that's almost faster than a mouse.</p>

<p>The final two special things about it that I'm going to group together, are the
dual-stage analog triggers and the grip buttons/paddles. The triggers let you
activate different actions depending on how far they are pressed or whether or
not they are "soft-pressed" (pressed partially) or "hard-pressed" (pressed all
the way down). This is potentially useful, but the only thing I've used it for
so far is to fire a single shot when "soft-pressed" or fire repeatedly when
"hard-pressed" in Squirm. The grips, on the other hand, are very useful, and
finally make use of all those fingers that hang out uselessly on the back of
the controller. Having those two extra actions is very useful, particularly
when chorded with other actions. For instance, on the most popular SpaceChem
config, pressing the right paddle pulls up a pop-up dialog that lets you select
commands using the right trackpad, which is otherwise used for normal mouse
movement. However, in the most simple usage of the grips, you can use them for
things like zoom camera while jumping without having to try to hold your thumb
on Y while pressing A repeatedly.</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<p>The Steam Controller is a very strange, unique controller that simultaneously
is so weird only people like me should/would use it, while also being so
fabulously better than a regular controller that everyone should use it. The
main thing holding it back is how much configuration and fiddling it needs for
<em>every game</em> in order to get it to a usable state. However, I would recommend
it as long as you're like me, and willing to dedicate your time to getting
something configured <em>exactly</em> how you want it to be.</p>

<p>I recently got on <a href="https://tilde.team">tilde.team</a>, a wonderful shared Linux system that has an
amazing community and awesome services. I'm currently writing this blog post
with their <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog">bashblog</a> program. I've just gotten signed up, so I'm still
poking around with the various services and it seems interesting.</p>

<p>I just wanted to create an initial post here, I'll update later when I have a
more complete impression or something new to write about.</p>
