<p>i finally got a real vps and migrated my website off of the amalgamation of
random <a href="https://xkcd.com/37/">ass-services</a> (i&rsquo;m not implying they were bad services) and
centralize them here. i had my main site (nytpu.com, excluding the blog) on
github pages (bleugh), my blog on tilde.team, and a bunch of random services
like nextcloud on my home &ldquo;server&rdquo; (totally not a desktop that doesn&rsquo;t have a
monitor) that has the worst uptime and reliability ever. i decided on
<a href="https://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> for hosting, for no particular reason. i also took the time to
migrate over to nginx because i got tired of apache (not that i ever hit a
point where i noticed the performance losses of apache but i just don&rsquo;t really
like it) but never got around to switching over, but now since i basically got
everything set up from scratch i figured i might as well. i <em>might</em> still run
nextcloud on my home server because i&rsquo;ve got 18tib of storage on there in a zfs
array and making use of it via a cloud would be nice</p>

<p>i've been enamoured with the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini protocol</a> ever since i've heard of it,
and am proud to be hosting this blog on gemini and gopher as well as on the web
(i'm actually the one who <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog/pulls/2">added gemini support</a> to the bashblog program
that i use to write this blog). i got that set up a few months ago (as of
writing this) but haven't really worked much with it other than that. well now,
i have plenty of time and due to a lack of other projects to be working on i'm
starting to experiment with gemini a little more.</p>

<p>i found this <a href="gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/">astrobotany</a> game (which is a port of the botany game i played
on ~team) and it gave me an idea that i'm <del>going to start</del> working on.
it's an interactive cgi (in the dynamic page generation sense not the movie
special effects sense) game thing, and i hope to push the limits of what the
gemini protocol can do, considering that you can't dynamically update a page
(which is an <em>objective</em> benefit for everything excluding games). i was
thinking old school text adventure, that probably wouldn't even be at a <em>Zork</em>
or <em>Dunnet</em> level but more <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>. since the issue isn't the
back end i was thinking running <a href="https://davidgriffith.gitlab.io/frotz/">frotz</a> (a z-machine interpreter) and
somehow wrapping gemini around the output, but we'll have to see how that goes
once i start getting server software up and running.</p>

<p>this whole post was originally meant just to plug gemini some more—because it's
amazing—but i ended up having some cool ideas that the gemini protocol (might)
be able to allow that gopher doesn't easily support, and the web is just too
bloated and it feels too much like actual work instead of a fun projects to get
anything up and running on there. i hope something of interest comes to
fruition because not much else has these past few months and i want more to
write about!</p>

<p>I don't pretend to be a film critic or anything, although I do have a taste for
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/341687-waves-98">obscure</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/8327-the-holy-mountain">avant</a>-<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/4960-synecdoche-new-york">garde</a> films as long as I can get meaning out of
it.  To get to the point, I just watched <em>The Wicker Man</em>, which a very
peculiar film because it <em>feels</em> like it should have some deeper meanings and
themes, like <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/361292-suspiria"><em>Suspira</em> (2018)</a> or <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/503919-the-lighthouse"><em>The Lighthouse</em></a>, and yet I can't
manage to pull anything out of it. It has Christian and Celtic <del>pagan</del>
heathen symbols, but I can't manage to figure out what they represent, unlike
in many other films where those have a deeper meaning connected with the rest
of the themes and plot. I was hoping to have more to say, but this post is
obviously going to be short because the whole point of it is that I can't
really say anything else about it other than: 1) it's really frustrating that I
can't pull any deeper meaning or themes from it even though it feels like I
should be able to; and 2) this actually is a really good horror film, and I
still wholeheartedly recommend it. It feels like <em>The Exorcist</em>, kind of, maybe
it's that they were both made in 1973 and they are both religious themed.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I plan on writing an analysis of <em>The Lighthouse</em>
sometime, because it's an excellent, excellent film, I just have to watch it
again first.</p>

playing with the steam controller
</a></h3>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This post is written in my long, rambling epistolary style because
I haven't really planned out what I wanted to say before writing it, so be
prepared.</p>

<p>I recently, out of boredom, dug out my steam controller that I've had lying
around since it launched (2015?). I remembered that it was pretty horrible to
use, but I don't have any other controllers that have a joystick. In fact, the
only other controller I have that works with modern computers is a <a href="https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-usb-controller">clone SNES
controller</a> (it wasn't that expensive when I got it) from the now-defunct
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP_(computer)">NextThingCo.</a> (I plan on writing about the PocketCHIP someday, because it's
amazing). However, once you get used to it, I've found that, excluding a few
exceptions, that the Steam Controller is equal to, or better than a controller
for many games, although I still prefer playing with a mouse or keyboard when
possible.  My current use case is playing on my couch using my "server" that's
plugged into my T.V., and the steam controller was specifically designed for
that purpose, so my use case is normal. </p>

<h2>using the controller</h2>

<p>After pulling the controller out and dusting it off, with some help from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamController/">the
SteamController subreddit</a> I pulled up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/778330/Squirm/">Squirm</a>, a wonderful platforming
game that I'd been meaning to replay anyways. After lots of fiddling with the
config, I finally got to a point where I could play through the early sections
semi-reliably. I was thinking "oh, it's okay" pretty much the whole time. After
I got to the spookelium boss, I then decided to mess with the config more and,
after 30 minutes of fiddling, got to a configuration where I felt much better
and more precise with my movements, as well as some QoL things like autofire.
"That was pretty neat" I thought, and proceeded to continue playing through the
game, all the way to the end, where the levels get punishingly difficult, and
that was where I really started getting to a point where I thought the
controller might be more useful than just a novelty.</p>

<p>Finishing Squirm, I played through an old favorite, Portal, and after some
rebinding and mouse sensitivity changes, I again got to a very usable,
enjoyable point. Making extensive use of the gyro for more precise aiming makes
for almost as quick and precise of an experience as using a mouse, which was
really unexpected. Playing Portal 2 with a similar profile had a similar
experience, leaving me very happy with a very strange controller I previously
thought was fairly useless.</p>

<h2>interesting features</h2>

<p>And now we get to where where I want to talk about the controller itself. My
favorite aspect of it is the gyro, which is nonexistent or completely unused in
any other controller. The only common controller that has a gyro that I know of
is the DualShock 4, but it goes mostly unused other than gimmicky things like
"shake the flashlight." Actually using the gyro though, gives you nearly the
speed and accuracy of an actual mouse, which is really amazing for a
controller.</p>

<p>The next thing about it, which is the first thing anyone notices about it, is
the two touchpads. I still think I prefer a joystick for movement, because it's
easier to use a joystick and tell where your finger is on it, and it has a
better tactile feel. I also think I still prefer actual buttons instead of
using the trackpad for buttons, because it's easier to rapid-fire press
buttons, or keep your finger on them instead of having to hover over the
trackpad. However, using the trackpad for either mouse movement or to emulate a
right-stick on a regular controller is where it really shines, as it is more
precise, easier to use, and just wonderful all around, especially when combined
with the gyro for super-precise aiming, that's almost faster than a mouse.</p>

<p>The final two special things about it that I'm going to group together, are the
dual-stage analog triggers and the grip buttons/paddles. The triggers let you
activate different actions depending on how far they are pressed or whether or
not they are "soft-pressed" (pressed partially) or "hard-pressed" (pressed all
the way down). This is potentially useful, but the only thing I've used it for
so far is to fire a single shot when "soft-pressed" or fire repeatedly when
"hard-pressed" in Squirm. The grips, on the other hand, are very useful, and
finally make use of all those fingers that hang out uselessly on the back of
the controller. Having those two extra actions is very useful, particularly
when chorded with other actions. For instance, on the most popular SpaceChem
config, pressing the right paddle pulls up a pop-up dialog that lets you select
commands using the right trackpad, which is otherwise used for normal mouse
movement. However, in the most simple usage of the grips, you can use them for
things like zoom camera while jumping without having to try to hold your thumb
on Y while pressing A repeatedly.</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<p>The Steam Controller is a very strange, unique controller that simultaneously
is so weird only people like me should/would use it, while also being so
fabulously better than a regular controller that everyone should use it. The
main thing holding it back is how much configuration and fiddling it needs for
<em>every game</em> in order to get it to a usable state. However, I would recommend
it as long as you're like me, and willing to dedicate your time to getting
something configured <em>exactly</em> how you want it to be.</p>

<p>I recently got on <a href="https://tilde.team">tilde.team</a>, a wonderful shared Linux system that has an
amazing community and awesome services. I'm currently writing this blog post
with their <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog">bashblog</a> program. I've just gotten signed up, so I'm still
poking around with the various services and it seems interesting.</p>

<p>I just wanted to create an initial post here, I'll update later when I have a
more complete impression or something new to write about.</p>
