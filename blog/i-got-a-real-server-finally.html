<p>i finally got a real vps and migrated my website off of the amalgamation of
random <a href="https://xkcd.com/37/">ass-services</a> (i&rsquo;m not implying they were bad services) and
centralize them here. i had my main site (nytpu.com, excluding the blog) on
github pages (bleugh), my blog on tilde.team, and a bunch of random services
like nextcloud on my home &ldquo;server&rdquo; (totally not a desktop that doesn&rsquo;t have a
monitor) that has the worst uptime and reliability ever. i decided on
<a href="https://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> for hosting, for no particular reason. i also took the time to
migrate over to nginx because i got tired of apache (not that i ever hit a
point where i noticed the performance losses of apache but i just don&rsquo;t really
like it) but never got around to switching over, but now since i basically got
everything set up from scratch i figured i might as well. i <em>might</em> still run
nextcloud on my home server because i&rsquo;ve got 18tib of storage on there in a zfs
array and making use of it via a cloud would be nice</p>
