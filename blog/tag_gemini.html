<p>i've been enamoured with the <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini protocol</a> ever since i've heard of it,
and am proud to be hosting this blog on gemini and gopher as well as on the web
(i'm actually the one who <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog/pulls/2">added gemini support</a> to the bashblog program
that i use to write this blog). i got that set up a few months ago (as of
writing this) but haven't really worked much with it other than that. well now,
i have plenty of time and due to a lack of other projects to be working on i'm
starting to experiment with gemini a little more.</p>

<p>i found this <a href="gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/">astrobotany</a> game (which is a port of the botany game i played
on ~team) and it gave me an idea that i'm <del>going to start</del> working on.
it's an interactive cgi (in the dynamic page generation sense not the movie
special effects sense) game thing, and i hope to push the limits of what the
gemini protocol can do, considering that you can't dynamically update a page
(which is an <em>objective</em> benefit for everything excluding games). i was
thinking old school text adventure, that probably wouldn't even be at a <em>Zork</em>
or <em>Dunnet</em> level but more <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>. since the issue isn't the
back end i was thinking running <a href="https://davidgriffith.gitlab.io/frotz/">frotz</a> (a z-machine interpreter) and
somehow wrapping gemini around the output, but we'll have to see how that goes
once i start getting server software up and running.</p>

<p>this whole post was originally meant just to plug gemini some more—because it's
amazing—but i ended up having some cool ideas that the gemini protocol (might)
be able to allow that gopher doesn't easily support, and the web is just too
bloated and it feels too much like actual work instead of a fun projects to get
anything up and running on there. i hope something of interest comes to
fruition because not much else has these past few months and i want more to
write about!</p>
